## Overview

Beamforming Simulator is a Python application designed for **Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Task 4**. This tool enables users to simulate and visualize beamforming scenarios for various applications such as 5G, Ultrasound, and Tumor Ablation. With an intuitive GUI, users can control parameters, visualize array factors, and pressure fields seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Load and Manage Scenarios:**
  - Import scenario files in JSON format for processing and visualization.

- **Parameter Adjustment:**
  - Adjust parameters such as frequency, number of elements, element spacing, and steering angle using sliders.

- **Scenario Selection:**
  - Choose from predefined scenarios like 5G, Ultrasound, and Tumor Ablation.

- **Visualization:**
  - Visualize array factors and pressure fields in real-time.

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Update parameters and scenarios interactively with immediate visual feedback.

## Application Interface

The graphical interface offers a clean and organized layout for streamlined user interaction.

#### Descriptions:
1. **Polar Plot Area:** Visualize the array factor in a polar plot.
2. **Element Position Plot:** Display the positions of the array elements.
3. **Pressure Field Plot:** Visualize the pressure field generated by the array.
4. **Interactive Controls:**
   - Sliders to adjust steering angle, number of elements, frequency, and element spacing.
   - Radio buttons to select between linear and curved array configurations.
   - Scenario selection radio buttons to choose between 5G, Ultrasound, and Tumor Ablation scenarios.

## How to Use

1. **Load Scenario:** Import scenario files using the predefined scenario selection radio buttons.
2. **Adjust Parameters:** Modify parameters such as steering angle, number of elements, frequency, and element spacing using the sliders.
3. **Select Configuration:** Use the radio buttons to switch between linear and curved array configurations.
4. **Visualize Results:** Observe the changes in the polar plot, element position plot, and pressure field plot as parameters are adjusted.
